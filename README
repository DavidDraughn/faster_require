A little utility to make

require 'xxx'

take much less time.

Well, mostly on windows--on linux it's a speedup of only 0.41 to 0.45s, or so. [1]

If you've ever wondered why ruby feels slow on doze...sometimes it's just the startup time.  This helps.

Benchmarks:

loading a single spec file:

  1.9.1   
    with 0.34s (10x improvement)
    without 3.20s

  1.8.6
    with 1.25s
    without 3.6s
    

rails app, running script/console "puts 333"

 1.9.1
    with:
      10s
   without:
      20s
 
 1.8.6 
   with:
       6s
   without:
       9s
       
running a rake -T

 1.9.1
   without: 3.75s
   with: 1.5s       

 1.8.6
   without: 1.37s
   with:    1.25s

How to use:

$ gem install faster_require
now put a require 'faster_require' somewhere (early on) in your script that you want to run.
   
Note: in reality what we should do is fix core so that it doesn't have such awful I/O time in windows.  There may be some gross inefficiency in there.  For now, this is a work-around.
   
[1] A sister project to this one, faster_gem_script, can make ruby scripts in linux run faster by 0.1s :) http://github.com/rdp/faster_gem_script
(in windows it's a much higher gain).  Eventually they'll be combined into one "gem optimizer" gem.
